v1.180,181,182  Apr 24, 2018
    Add WSPR background autorun mode.
        See instructions on admin page, "extensions" tab, WSPR menu entry.

v1.179  Apr 19, 2018
    Fix for Chrome's new "no autoplay" audio policy. Display the "click to start OpenWebRX"
        overlay that is used with iOS mobile devices.
    Fix to eliminate audio glitches when a large dx list is edited/updated from the web interface.

v1.176,177,178  Apr 18, 2018
    The Kiwi GPS now receives Galileo satellites in addition to Navstar and QZSS.
        A GPS antenna with restricted sky visibility will now have more satellites to choose from
        and should produce position/time solutions more often.
        Please consider attaching the GPS antenna to your Kiwi, especially if yours is a
        public Kiwi listed on sdr.hu  This will assist with ongoing HF direction finding experiments
        as well as serve as a source of frequency calibration for your Kiwi.
        Thanks to Christoph Mayer for important insight and bug fixes.
    Admin GPS tab now has Google map display.
    Support Vivado 2017.4 for building FPGA image.

v1.171  Feb 11, 2018
    Admin GPS tab additions.
        Shadow map. Shows long term areas of non-reception caused by "shadowing" of buildings and terrain.
        For Asia/Oceania, a locator for the new geosynchronous QZS-3 sat will appear as a circle.
            Combined with the shadow map this will indicate if QZS-3 is likely to be received.

v1.170  Feb 8, 2018
    Added GPS support for Japan's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS).
        Should have reception over entire Asia-Oceania region (heard fine in New Zealand).

        EFR Teleswitch decoding improvements.
        CHU decoding working.

        header information and the first 80 characters of the message.

v1.157  Jan 16, 2018
    Fix user display on admin status tab
    Add volume URL parameter, e.g. kiwisdr:8073/?vol=100
        vol = 0 to 200(%), default is 50%

v1.156  Jan 12, 2018
    Fixed FAX frequencies: Athens (way off) and Northwood UK 4 MHz (100 Hz error).
    Added GPS tracking PLL IQ display to admin interface.
    Added scope display to Navtex extension.

v1.154  Jan 2, 2018
    New Navtex extension.
    Major user interface changes:
        New “option tab” user interface for lower right control panel.
        Removed lower left status panel. Replaced with the new "Users" and "Stats" option tabs.
        Next/previous history buttons next to frequency entry box.
            If using a keyboard press return key to select displayed frequency.
            Otherwise prior frequency will return after three seconds.
            Doesn't really work yet for mobile devices.
        Added numeric dBm value to S-meter.
        Added classic LMS denoiser and autonotch to audio tab. Filter controls on extension panel.
            The LMS filters are not a panacea for all filtering problems.
            They are tricky to adjust and don't work in all situations.
            The presets are a work-in-progress.
        Added audio mute icon/button to right of spectrum button (renamed "Spec" to fit).
        WF option tab
            Number after "WF" on option tab button is current zoom level, e.g. "WF10"
            "Auto Scale" button: automatically sets WF min/max.
                Best when there are a range of signal levels.
            "Slow Dev" button: Use when you have audio drops on slow mobile devices (e.g. old iPad).
                Uses single color in spectrum and slower waterfall speed.
            "colormap" & "contrast" menus: beginnings of waterfall colormap control. Work-in-progress.
            "spec filter" menu: variable spectrum time constant so decay time can be varied.
        Add URL parameter to set initial waterfall speed:
            wf={0, off, 1, 1hz, s, slow, m, med, f, fast} e.g. kiwi:8073/?wf=1hz
        Fixed problem with NDB database lookup not working.
        Removed “less buffering” and “compression” buttons from Audio tab until they are working.

        The "WF max" slider.
        Sound "Less buffering" (formerly "SND") and "Compression" buttons.

    Fixed problem with Kiwi server geolocation of user connections randomly failing.
    Added a "continue anyway" button to the javascript version mismatch dialog.

    Stop IBP_scan waterfall annotations after extension closed.

v1.142  Nov 12, 2017
    New repository https://github.com/jks-prv/Beagle_GPS
    A version of KiwiSDR with the SDR code removed for people who only want to experiment with GPS.
    Easier to understand and compiles faster than full KiwiSDR repo.
    Except for the FPGA simulation, this is a replacement for http://www.jks.com/sdgps/sdgps.html

v1.141  Nov 7, 2017
    Admin webpage tab has textarea input for HTML that is added to the <head> element of
    the main page. Useful to add for example Javascript to setup Google analytics.

v1.140  Nov 1, 2017
    Bug fix allowing IQ mode in labels (kiwi.config/dx.json file).

v1.139  Nov 1, 2017
    New IQ demodulator mode (button to the right of NBFM) that, among other things, allows
    DRM decoding using the external Dream application. Requires use of
    "virtual audio cable" software on your computer to route the browser audio output to the
    input of Dream or other app. See the KiwiSDR forum for details.

v1.138  Oct 25, 2017
    Improvements from VE3SUN:
        IBP: Waterfall annotation of IBP station callsign.
        IBP: Waterfall autosave to jpg file.
        "DX cluster lookup" right-button menu entry.
        25-entry last frequency memory. Use keyboard up/down keys to access.

v1.137  Oct 16, 2017
    Security improvements:
        No more storage of admin password in cookies.
        Create file kiwi.config/opt.no_console to disable root console capability completely.
        File kiwi.config/opt.admin_ip can limit admin connections to single ipv4/ipv6 address
        on the local network (put ip address in file).
        Note: for security reasons it makes no sense to put these options _in_ the admin webpage.

v1.136  Oct 11, 2017
    Update needed because kiwisdr.com moved to a new server.

v1.135  Oct 8, 2017
    Bug fix in time limit exemption password code.

v1.134  Oct 8, 2017
    Bug fix in time limit code.

v1.133  Oct 8, 2017

    on the top bar will be removed. Before the items would overlap making them unreadable.

v1.132  Oct 2, 2017
    Bug fix.

v1.131  Oct 2, 2017
    Added 24hr per-ip address connect time limit to admin interface. Now you can limit how long
    a particular ip address can connect during a 24 hour period.

v1.130  Sep 30, 2017
    Added a GPS Azimuth/Elevation display option.
